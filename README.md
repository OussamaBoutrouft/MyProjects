FOOTBALL-ANALYTICS-PROJECTS
Football Data Analytics using Python and R
I am passionate about leveraging data analytics to gain insights into football. My projects demonstrate a range of skills and techniques in this domain, including:

Data Scraping: I use Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Selenium, pandas, and requests to scrape football data from various sources. This allows me to create comprehensive datasets for analysis.

Data Visualization: Creating detailed visualizations is key to understanding football data. I employ libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, and networkx to produce visual representations, including pass networks, heat maps, and other insightful plots.

Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning: Applying statistical methods and machine learning models is essential for predicting match outcomes, player performance, and other metrics. I utilize Python libraries such as scikit-learn, statsmodels, numpy, and pandas to build these models.

Specialized Visualizations: I create pizza charts to present player statistics in an easy-to-understand and visually appealing format. This involves using matplotlib, pandas, and numpy.

Additionally, I am proficient in using R programming for data analytics, employing libraries such as tidyverse, ggplot2, caret, and dplyr to perform data wrangling, visualization, and statistical analysis.

My projects showcase these competencies and demonstrate my ability to apply data analytics techniques to real-world football scenarios, providing valuable insights into the game.
