FOOTBALL-ANALYTICS-PROJECTS
Football Data Analytics using Python

I am passionate about leveraging data analytics to gain insights into football. My projects demonstrate a range of skills and techniques in this domain, including:

Data Scraping: I use Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Selenium, pandas, and requests to scrape football data from various sources. This allows me to create comprehensive datasets for analysis.

Data Visualization: Creating detailed visualizations is key to understanding football data. I employ libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, and networkx to produce visual representations, including pass networks, heat maps, and other insightful plots.

Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning: Applying statistical methods and machine learning models is essential for predicting match outcomes, player performance, and other metrics. I utilize Python libraries such as scikit-learn, statsmodels, numpy, and pandas to build these models.

Specialized Visualizations: I create pizza charts to present player statistics in an easy-to-understand and visually appealing format. This involves using matplotlib, pandas, and numpy.

My projects showcase these competencies and demonstrate my ability to apply data analytics techniques to real-world football scenarios, providing valuable insights into the game.
